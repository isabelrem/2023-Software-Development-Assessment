# Remaining issues
* when selecting disease name from list - would be nice if we could select by numbered position on list rather than having to write out the whole condition name - any typo and goes straight back to beginning. 
* Error response from daemon: Could not find the file /app/panelsearch_downloads in container panelsearch
* get it to ask for the genome build before the test code / test name
* one file to both run and rerun panelsearch
* clean up print statements and errant comments
